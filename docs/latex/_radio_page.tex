A real time telemetry system was implemented by a radio bridge. $SCU_{REAR}$ is connected to a radio transmission module, which sends the telemetry data to a receiving radio module placed at the boxes. The data is serialized in J\+S\+ON format and encrypted using A\+ES with a 192bit key (in C\+TR mode). The ciphertext thus obtained is coded in base64 and sent via radio. In reception, the text is decoded and decrypted and sent via serial port to a computer. The data thus obtained are deserialized by a multiplatform application developed in Java\+FX, which has the ability to graph the values of the various sensors in real time and to save them in log files to be analyzed later.
